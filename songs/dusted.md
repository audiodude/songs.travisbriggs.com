I was originally thinking of this chord progression and the downtempo rhodes as kind of a rock ballad of sorts. But I never wrote any words, and it kind of evolved into a pretty groovy electronic piece. This is the kind of electronica that I like making, honestly, not too genre specific but with a good groove.
