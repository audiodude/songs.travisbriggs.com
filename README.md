# songs.travisbriggs.com
This is the static site generator setup that powers [songs.travisbriggs.com](https://songs.travisbriggs.com).

It is written with lots of help from
[this fabulous article](https://nicolas.perriault.net/code/2012/dead-easy-yet-powerful-static-website-generator-with-flask/)

It uses Python, [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/), [Flask-FlatPages](https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-FlatPages/) and
[Frozen-Flask](https://pythonhosted.org/Frozen-Flask/).

Note that the repository contains metadata for mp3 files but not the actual mp3s themselves.

# Your version

If you'd like to make your own version of a site based on this one, I've already done the work of
cleaning out the personal content. That version is [on Github as well](https://github.com/audiodude/rainfall).
