# songs.travisbriggs.com
This is the static site generator setup that powers [songs.travisbriggs.com].

It is written with lots of help from
[this fabulous article](https://nicolas.perriault.net/code/2012/dead-easy-yet-powerful-static-website-generator-with-flask/)

It uses Python, [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/), [Flask-FlatPages](https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-FlatPages/) and
[Frozen-Flask](https://pythonhosted.org/Frozen-Flask/).

Note that the repository contains metadata for mp3 files but not the actual mp3s themselves.
